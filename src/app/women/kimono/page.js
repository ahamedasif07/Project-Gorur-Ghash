        description="Kimonos by Ghash, are an oldie but a goody. A foolproof way of elevating your style without lifting a finger or using a brain cell is throwing on a kimono/shrug over an outfit. It immediately adds an extra layer of elegance. You’ll make a lasting impression anywhere you go.

When you’re not in the mood to dress up but have to, just throw on a kimono as an accent piece and call it a day!  The floral patterns and fringe details add visual interest to your otherwise simple attire, making you look effortlessly chic in a matter of seconds.

Plus, they only come in free sizes. So you don’t have to worry about the fit."
